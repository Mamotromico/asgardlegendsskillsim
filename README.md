# asgardlegendsskillsim

Skill simulator for the [Asgard Legends](https://www.asgardlegend.com/) server similar to the ones hosted by the iRO Wiki ( https://irowiki.org/~himeyasha/skill6/ ). Since the server is a heavily modified version of the base Ragnarok Online game, no skill simulator is compatible to it.

Still a work in progress, not useable at the moment.

Project created with the Vue.JS CLI tool. [Using Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/), and [Vue Class Components](https://class-component.vuejs.org/)
